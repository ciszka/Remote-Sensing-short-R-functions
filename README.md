# Remote-Sensing-short-R-functions
These are small functions that I wrote to improve and practice my R programming skills
The majority of these are written for rasterstack objects, which means that the raster library
should be used in order for these functions to run properly that include multiple bands of imagery
for remote sensing applications. Functions written for other uses will be included in another 
repository.
